## DePOR Token
Before DePOR Chain goes online, DPO will issue ERC20 protocol tokens on Ethereum ; after DePOR Chain goes online, DPO (ERC20) will be mapped to the DePOR Chain mainnet in the same proportion , and at the same time all tokens on Ethereum will be invalid.

DPO is the only certificate for all products and ecological circulation of DePOR , and it is mainly used in the following four categories:
- Six Degrees of Separation Network Construction
- RPOS validator pledge
- Voting and governance
- Ecological circulation consumption
