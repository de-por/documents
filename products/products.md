### 2.DePOR.protocol 
DePOR.protocol is a cross-chain protocol. In the initial stage, developers will optimize the protocol for mainstream currencies such as BTC and ETH to ensure the smooth flow of cross-chain transaction channels for all mainstream currencies. After the development community grows stronger, the open source code of the protocol allows all developers to access other currencies that need to be cross-chain.

### 3. DeFarm 
DeFarm is a decentralized project release center, DeFarm may be freely distributed innovation projects by 6DOS networks, global quality projects are by DeFarm can complete the transformation to upgrade, bring a block chain innovation revolution.

### 4. Decentralized Exchange Porsche

Porsche DEX will satisfy multi-chain and cross-chain barrier-free transactions. Whether Porsche needs to turn on liquidity mining will pass DePOR.governance voting resolution

### 5. Decentralized agency mechanism DEAO 

After DEAO goes online, agents will be able to obtain rebates through the DPO of the sales circulation pool . DEAO uses the method of credit line + guaranteed amount to evaluate and motivate all agents. Before opening an agent, you must activate the 6DOS Network node and agree to the relevant terms of the agent. We ensure that all sales activities are within the scope of legal permission.

The commission data of each agent level is as follows:
