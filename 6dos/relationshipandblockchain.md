## Interpersonal relationship and blockchain

Interpersonal relationship is a kind of social relationship established by people in the process of production or life activities. This kind of relationship will have an impact on people's psychology and will form a certain sense of distance in people's psychology.

### 2. Status Quo of Interpersonal Relationship Applications
According to the current Internet network environment, we divide interpersonal relationship applications into the following categories:
#### 2.1  Recruitment and job hunting
For example, LinkedIn has three different user products, which also embodies three core values.

- **Professional identity**

Professional identity is presented as a personal file. The LinkedIn platform can easily create, manage, and share online professional files to fully show yourself in the workplace. A complete personal profile is the stepping stone to successful job search and professional social networking.

At LinkedIn, personal files contain six important parts.

(1) Head portrait display: A clear and generous head portrait will immediately add visibility and realism to the file.

Occupation overview: comprehensive display of professional background, fields, goals and interests. Write "Next Work Plan".

(2) Work experience: Display work experience, whether full-time or part-time, and provide details related to the position so that archive visitors can quickly understand work information.

(3) Educational background: A sound educational background will improve the competitiveness of personal files, fill in information such as summer programs and exchange schools, and show a comprehensive self. Fill in the education background, file views increased by 10 times.

(4)Skills recognition: add multiple skills and get the approval of the contact. The more recognition, the more attractive the file.

(5) Recommendation letter: Invite friends, classmates, teachers or colleagues to write recommendation letters, which will greatly increase the authenticity of the file. Make skills and work experience more recognized.

- **Knowledge insight**

Pay attention to industry information, learn personal opinions, learn professional knowledge, improve professional skills, and share business insights.

- **Business opportunity**

Find classmates, colleagues, and partners on LinkedIn, search for positions, company information, and discover opportunities.

#### 2.2 Social media
This type of media software is mainly divided into two categories:
- Point-to-point chat services, such as telegram , skype , line , and wechat belong to this type of social tools. They are mainly used to communicate between acquaintances and provide group chat functions to facilitate the same hobby, the same organization, or other People who join group chats for a common purpose. Between acquaintances and non-acquaintances, the user context may be very different.
- Expand social categories, such as twitter and facebook are world-renowned social platforms for publishing opinions and sharing life. They are mainly used to share life between strangers, to expand their horizons, expand their contacts, find and follow people with similar interests , and form a subtle relationship between fans and bloggers.

### 3.Six Degrees of Separation theory
Stanley Milgram, a famous social psychologist at Harvard University in the United States, first proposed the Six Degrees of Separation theory in 1967. Through the chain letter experiment, I found the theory of six degrees of separation. Simply put: "There will be no more than six people between you and any stranger. That is to say, you can know any one through at most six people. stranger."

Assuming that one person knows 260 people on average, its six degrees is 2606 = 308,915,776,000,000 (about 300 trillion). Excluding some duplicates, the remaining number is also several times the total number of people on the planet. The formula can be further abstracted into:

Where n is the complexity, N is the total number of people, and W is the contact width of each person.

The Rule of 150 was proposed by Robin Dunbar, an anthropologist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Dunbar inferred from the intelligence and social network of apes that human intelligence will allow humans to have a stable social network. The number of people is 148. After rounding, it is 150 people. 150 has become our generally accepted "maximum number of people with whom we can maintain social relations." It can be simply calculated: the number of people through the interpersonal network of 6 people is 150 to the 6th power, which is far greater than the total number of people in human history. , Can confirm the Six Degrees of Separation theory from the side, clearly explaining that six people can establish contact with any person in the world.

### 4. Relationship Blockchainization
